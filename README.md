# The Zebra Project
In 7th grade, my engineering teacher assigned us a quick mental exercise as busywork: list one hundred things you could do with a zebra. By the next day, I had printed out my list of 500. Since then, my friends and I have slowly been accumulating more words. This repository contains the list in its entirety, alphabetized for your convenience, of things one could do with a zebra.
